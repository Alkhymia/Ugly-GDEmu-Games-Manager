## What is Ugly GDEmu Games Manager
UGGM is a software to manage your games on the SD card you have for GDEmu, as it can be cumbersome.

It allows you to:
* Copy the games from your PC on your SD card. It will find what must the name of folder (02,03 ,04, etc.) and create it. If an empty folder already exists, it will use it.
* Shrink (optionnaly) the games while copying them on your SD card. The files on your PC won't be shrinked.
* Remove Games from your SD card.
* Show which games on your PC are not on your SD card.

It also shows the free space on your SD card and the size of your games.

## Roadmap
1. Sort games alphabetically in the SD card
2. Copy games from SD to PC.
3. Increment the progress bar more gradually.

## Technical roadmap
1. Use the last version of gditools with IronPython to shrink the games.

## Would be nice to have
