## What is Ugly GDEmu Games Manager

UGDEmuGM is a software to manage games on the SD card you have for GDEmu, as it can be cumbersome.

It allows you to:
* Copy the games from your PC on your SD card. It will find what must the name of folder (02,03 ,04, etc.) and create it. If an empty folder already exists, it will use it.
* Remove Games from your SD card
* Show which games on your PC are not on your SD card

It also shows the free space on your SD card and the size of your games.


## Roadmap

1. Move all file manipulation code to BLL
2. Copy files from SD to PC
3. Increment the progress bar more gradually by copying files chunk by chunk


## Would be nice to have

* Shrink option (checkbox for each game as some do not work shrinked)
* Add cover from https://archive.org/details/670dreamcastgamesjewelcoverpicturesconvertedto256x256.pvrfilesforgdemu.7z
