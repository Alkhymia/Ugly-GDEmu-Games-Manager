## What is Ugly GDEmu Games Manager
UGDEmuGM is a software to manage games on the SD card you have for GDEmu, as it can be cumbersome.

It allows you to:
* Copy the games from your PC on your SD card. It will find what must the name of folder (02,03 ,04, etc.) and create it. If an empty folder already exists, it will use it.
* Shrink the games while copying them on your SD card. The files on your PC won't be shrinked.
* Remove Games from your SD card.
* Show which games on your PC are not on your SD card.

It also shows the free space on your SD card and the size of your games.

WARNING: EDIT: The tool does not work well with the SD Card Maker of MadSheep for the time being. I will fix that in the future release. For the time being, use just one of them, not both at the same time.

## Roadmap
1. Improve how the name of the game is retrieve.
2. Make tool compatible with Mad Sheep SD Card Maker
3. Sort games alphabetically in the SD card
4. Copy files from SD to PC.
5. Increment the progress bar more gradually.

## Technical roadmap
